## 2.2.10 (2021-02-23)
- do not rewrite `config.php` files during deployment, it is a terrible idea as

  - remove `bin/update-ip.php` and keep using the default IPs
  - remove `bin/update-api-secrets.php` and string replace them in depoy script
  - we *do* have `bin/suggest-ip.php` if you want to randomly generate nice 
    private IPv4 and IPv6 ranges and transplant them in your configuration file
    manually

- always allow tls-crypt key generation
